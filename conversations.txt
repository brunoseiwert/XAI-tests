        Other features such as the credit amount, installment commitment, number of existing credits, duration of the loan,

        However, the age feature had the highest impact.
        If you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to ask.

User: Why is a higher age good for my credit rating?

Assistant: A higher age is generally considered favorable for credit ratings
        because it implies more financial stabilityand a longer credit history.
        Lenders typically view older individuals as having a higher likelihood of having established a positive credit track record
        and being responsible with their financial obligations.
        This perception of reliability and experience in managing finances increases the chances of obtaining a good credit rating.
        However, it's important to note that age is just one factor among many that lenders consider when assessing creditworthiness.
