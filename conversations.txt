### Conversation 1

User:  Why was my loan rejected?

The model rejected your loan request primarily because of the duration of the loan.
The longer the duration, the more likely it is for the loan to be rejected.

User:  What impacted the decision negatively?

The factors that had a negative impact on the decision were the duration of the loan and the credit amount.
A longer duration and a higher credit amount resulted in a higher chance of loan rejection.

User:  Was my age important?

Yes, your age also played a role in the decision.
The model considered your age and it had a positive impact, meaning that being older increased the likelihood of getting a good credit rating.
However, it was not the most influential factor in this case.

User:  What can I do to get the loan?

To improve your credit rating and increase the chances of getting the loan, you can consider reducing the duration of the loan to 4 months and lowering the credit amount to 7191.
These changes would have a positive impact on your credit rating.

User:  How many people was this model trained on?

The model was trained on 800 instances.


### Conversation 2

User:  Why did the model decide this?

The model gave the user a bad credit rating because the duration of the loan was longer than 24 months.
This was the most important factor in the model's decision.

User:  Did my age influence the decision?

Yes, your age did influence the decision.
The model considered your age to be an important factor in determining the credit rating.

User:  In what way was it important?

Your age had a positive influence on the decision, meaning that it was considered a favorable factor for the credit rating.

User:  So why did my loan get rejected even if my age had positive influence?

While your age had a positive influence on the decision, suggesting a favorable credit rating,
there were other factors that had a stronger negative impact, leading to the rejection of your loan.
These factors include the duration of the loan, as well as the amount of credit and the installment commitment.

User:  How can I get the loan?

In order to improve your credit rating and increase your chances of getting the loan,
you can make the following changes: reduce the duration of the loan to 4 months and decrease the credit amount to 7191.
By making these changes, the model predicts that your credit rating would definitely change.
